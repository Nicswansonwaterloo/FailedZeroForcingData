# FailedZeroForcingData
A reposity for data pertaining to failed zero forcing, based on this paper:
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.03821

The graphs are stored in graph6 format. See
https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/data/formats.html
or 
https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/format/Graph6.html

The exaughstive list of graphs for which F(G) = k for 1 <= k <= 4 are found in small_fg folder.
The exaughstive list of graphs for which F(G) = Z(G) = k are stored in the fg_eq_zf folder.
The exaughstive list of graphs for which F(G) = Z(G) up to 10 vertices are stored in the fg_eq_zf_by_n folder, categorized by number of vertices.
